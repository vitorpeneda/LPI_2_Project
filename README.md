LPI_2_Project- Minho University
===============================

Weather Station

Hello :)

These files are a course project ( from Laboratórios e práticas integradas II ) done by a group of students from the 3rd year of Industrial Electronics Engineering and Computers (University of Minho).
The project consists of a Weather Station with wireless data transmitter (RF). It Allows to save data in a file .txt and the user can access the data through C# / Excel applications.

About these files:
The files .cpp and .h must be build in the MCU1 except the receiver.cpp must be built in the MCU2. Both built in the Atmel Studio Software. 
The files .cs must be build in the Microsoft Visual Studio Desktop Software to change the C# application. Can run the .exe C# application directly. 
The file .xlsm must be used on Excel Software.

Enjoy and good work ;)

Best regards,
The Group
